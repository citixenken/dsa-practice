Node-based data structure (Node...type of data that wraps our data)

=> Singly Linked - one-way (next?:Node<T>)
=> Doubly Linked - bi-directional (prev?:Node<T>) and (next?:Node<T>)

A node contains a value and references to another(next) node. One can therefore walk through this daisy-chain of nodes that contain values.
