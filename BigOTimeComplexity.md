Time
Memory(Space)

=> As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?
=> Growth is with respect to the input
=> Constants are dropped
=> Worst case is usually the way we measure

# Fastest to slowest (Operations v. Elements)

O(1) => Constant Time

O(log n)
=> BSTs

O(n) => Linear Time

O(nlog n)
=> Quicksort

O(n^2)

O(2^n)

O(n!)
