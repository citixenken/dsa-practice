Uses a "Divide and Conquer" technique

=> The algorithm picks a pivot element and rearranges the array so elements smaller than the pivot element move to the left side of the pivot, and elements greater move to the right side.

=> The algorithm then recursively sorts the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot element.
